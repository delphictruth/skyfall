# Chapter 5 ish
die for you — grabbitz 

When she turns the page, she's surprised to see a new hand — spidery and slanted, the ink darker, bolder. Written with more force than the delicate script that she's become quite familiar with. 

She traces her finger over the scrawl, picking out some vaguely familiar words in the Ancient Language. She recognizes *oro*, arrow, and manages to pick out *sláegr*, but she doesn't know what it means. The rest is too difficult to make out, oddly smeared. 

Below that, Cecilé's hand resumes, neat and clean: *gladro liduen*.

*Liduen*, she places after a moment, for script. Again, her spotty knowledge of the Ancient Language frustates her when staring at *gladro* produces no familiarity, and she makes a note to ask Bastille before moving on.

To her surprise, that spidery writing — *liduen*, she thinks with a slight smile — reappears right below, copying down the same spell. 

After a moment, she realizes why it looks so different: there's no smudging. She compares it to the earlier writing, and it's definitely the same hand, only much clearer. 

"*Liduen*," she murmurs, tracing her finger over the spell as she glances between the two. A spell about writing. Perhaps *gladro* is— clean? Neat? 

Still, the smudging of the original script confuses her. It's not that the writing itself is necessarily untidy. It just looks like someone had dragged a finger through the wet ink, potentially to obscur it. Or an accident? 

***Raegal was left-handed, like his son***, Zaniel suddenly hums, sounding amused. 

Hazel jolts, glancing down at the Eldunarí nestled carefully in her lap. With a flush, she realizes that she's been sitting here puzzling over the foreign script when she has a perfectly good dragon to question, and then she registers what he said.

"*Ah*," she breathes, understanding dawning as she looks closer at the writing. She imagines trying to write with her left, with her hand dragging on the page behind her, and shudders at how annoying it sounds. 

It answers another mystery, too: who Cecilé would have let write in her journal. She's embarrassed that she didn't stop to consider her husband sooner, but she consoles herself with the knowledge that she hadn't yet stopped to guess. 

"So then, this is a spell? For his hand-writing?" she asks, tapping at Cecilé neat renditioning, and she feels Zaniel's focus narrow, borrowing her sight momentarily. 

***Yes***, he agrees, withdrawing before the disorientation can sink in, ***This was Starlight's first version of the spell. Clever, but it must be recast each time you write. So she came up with something even cleverer, and enchanted the ink instead.***

Zaniel sounds boasting, his obvious pride filtering through his recounting, and Hazel smiles. "And this— *gladro*?"

***Enchanted, of course***, he says, making that odd snickering noise of his. ***This is gladr, enchantment. You know the word for spell?***

"Oh!" she says, and then laughs with a slight flutter of embarrassment. Yes, she *does* know *gladr*, but it'd been one of the very first words she'd ever learned. And, after a moment, she remembers the past tense modification: an *o*. "Thank you, Zaniel."

He preens with the gratitude, settling comfortably into the back of her thoughts once more. His smug contentment makes her smile again. 

She runs her finger over the spell one more time, and then begins flipping through the journal curiously once more. Raegal's hand becomes a staple, scattered in among Cecilé's notes, and she realizes that they are modifying one another's spells, noting down suggestions for improvement. 

She doesn't know half the words — more than half, even — but what she can puzzle out is utterly fascinating. She can see their thought processes playing out across these very pages; can track their logic and marvel at the sheer creativity it demonstrates, how complimentary their opposing approaches are. 

*You are limited by only three things: your knowledge of the Ancient Language, your energy, and your creativity*, Bastille had told her, and she wonders how often he had paged through these journals, teaching himself to be as inventive as his parents. Learning *from* them, as impossible as it should be. 

She feels a flutter of acknowledgement from Zaniel, but the dragon makes no comment on her quiet observations. With a hum, Hazel resumes her reading, only interrupting his peace occasionally when she finds she *must* know a word's meaning. For the others, she resigns herself to be patient and wait for Bastille to return with Arion. 

One page she comes across seems busier than the others, and she realizes that Raegal's scrawl is more prominent. The spell written across the top of the page is long and in his hand, spanning several lines, and Hazel realizes that there are several renditions listed under it. 

She takes her time picking her way through the words, struggling to place their meaning, but they are mostly foreign and the sentence is so long that she loses track whenever she tries to string together any of the words she *does* recognize. 

Cecilé's script re-appears half-way down the page, striking through some of his words and suggesting new ones. The very last version features only two corrections, and one, she realizes, isn't actually Cecilé's.

It looks quite like her hand, but after a second glance she realizes that it's bolder, faintly slanted, and, with a jolt, slightly smudged from a left-handed author. 

*Bastille.*

She taps his addition lightly, marveling slightly. It's the first time she's seen him add to the journal, and she gently flips through the remaining pages quickly, skimming for a reappearance. 

It's the *only* time he's added, she decides, and turns back to the change. She doesn't recognize the word he replaced, nor the one he jotted below. 

With a flare of disappointment, she tracks backwards to Cecilé's, hoping (but doubting) that it'll give her a clue. To her delight, she *knows* it. 

*Du Namar Aurboda*, she notes, is a relatively common phrase — one she knew even before Arion had hatched for her. *The Banishing of Names.* 

Infamously, after the fall of the Old Rider Order, the dragons had come together to banish the names of those who had turned on them from history. No— from *existence.* Not one of the Forsworn's dragons could be named today, their names banished from all languages. 

*Aurboda*, Cecilé had written delicately, and Hazel traces over it thoughtfully. Banish. A banishing spell, perhaps? 

She wonders if they were trying to recreate the dragons' magic. Hadn't Talia said that the more complicated the spell, the longer it would be? This one is certainly long enough. 

Still, it's an odd thing to try to replicate. Hazel thinks that it must have just been a matter of idle curiosity, of wondering if they *could* recreate the Banishing with all of their cleverness. 

Based on the fact that Bastille had made a change, so many years after their deaths, she decides that they must have failed. 

Unable to resist her own curiosity, she prods gently at Zaniel's consciousness, rousing him from the half-sleep he'd drifted into. 

"Zaniel, do you know what this was for?" she asks, tapping her finger to it to direct his attention once she feels the slight pressure of his thoughts, and then adds, "This— banishing spell, I think."

Hazel feels Zaniel take a closer look at her words, staring through her eyes, and then— to her shock— she feels him *recoil* from her thoughts. 

***That horror***, he hisses, inching even further from her thoughts, as if to distance himself from the mere thought of it, ***is a terrible, awful thing. It will kill you and your dragon and everyone else. Get rid of it!***

She's stunned by the depth of emotion she feels from him, the utter revolusion, fear, and grief eminating from the usually carefree dragon.

Hazel has never heard a dragon so— *enraged.* She stares down at his eldunarí, at a loss for words, and carefully shuts the journal, hiding the spell out of sight. 

"I'm sorry," she says gently after a moment, hesitating, "I didn't mean to upset you. I won't try to read it again, but what—"

***I can't explain it to you***, he interrupts, sounding unnerved but less volatile, ***Even I do not fully understand its wretched sorcery, but I can show you.***

Zaniel seems somewhat reluctant, and Hazel hesitates. She truly doesn't want to upset him further, but she also senses a sort of determination — as if he feels he must show her to ensure she understands the danger. 

Still. Hazel isn't sure if *she* wants to see it, if it makes Zaniel react so viscerally. 

And then she thinks of Bastille, reading it closely enough to make amendments, and she swallows. She *needs* to see what it is. 

Zaniel feels her assent and, before she can second guess, envelops her in his memories. 

--- 

*Hot smoke rises above the mountains, trembling in the sky. Hazel— no, Zaniel tenses his wings, nudging tiny-faerie-Starlight more urgently with his nose.*

***Come!** he insists, uncomfortable with the worry pressing down on him. She's staring out towards the smoke, waving a hand at him to be patient, and he nudges her harder.*

*Before he can snatch her up in his claws and whisk her and her little lights away, a roar rumbles across the Southern Point. It is echoed a moment later, and Zaniel shifts his weight anxiously.*

*"We have to help," Starlight breathes, and he feels her distress crash over him in waves. "Michael and Niernen are alone!"*

*Zaniel lashes his tail. ***You cannot help them—***

*There is another deafening roar, and then they rise above the mountain tops.*

*It's too far for even he to identify the traiter-kin, the flashing of their scales irritating and unworthy to even look at. But he recognizes Niernen's glimmering metal-iron-silver as she rises after them.*

*She is so lithe and quick. She looks like something blessed compared to those vile wretches, but she is also more slender than they. Less bulky.*

*She is badly outmatched by their size, and Zaniel worries. But he can't betray his oath.*

*Starlight inhales sharply as Niernen spirals swiftly upwards, the other two giving chase into the clouds. She turns and starts to clamber up his shoulder at long last, her little-warm fingers ghosting across his scales.*

*"Please, Zani," she begs, tucking herself into the dip of his neck. Safe. "At least let me help them— we only need to get a bit closer, and I can send them energy from here."*

*Agitated, he steps from one paw to the other, eager to lunge into the air and flee. But Starlight's horror keeps him rooted in place, and Niernen's outraged cry makes him shiver.*

*"Zani!" she urges again, sounding desperate.*

*He shudders as his oath wriggles under his skin, cold-hot, indecisive. Is he still keeping her safe, if they do not go too close? Is he keeping her from danger? Yes, he thinks he is, but—*

*There is an anguished roar, shrill and terrible, and they look as one to see Niernen speeding straight down, quicksilver-fast. When she suddenly pulls up sharply, roaring her fury to the skies, Zaniel realizes that her Rider must have fallen.*

*"He's alive," Starlight says, sounding shaken, and Zaniel lunges into the air, skimming close to the ground as he inches closer to the base of the mountains. Just a little closer, until he too can sense Niernen's-Michael through the pulsing energies.*

***She caught him***, *he suggests, crouching low so that his belly is pressed to the ground. For once, he curses his shiny-bright-blue-green scales. So glorious he is, but so visible, even wriggling through the green-grass.

*"Yes," she whispers, and he feels her reaching out. He reaches with her, bolstering her mental grasp, and together they grab ahold of Niernen's consciousness.*

*Her mind writhes with dismay and panic, hot with anger, but her wards are strong. They shudder with each pounding blow from the traitors, but hold fast — and after a moment, they accept Starlight and him.*

***Take our energy***, *Starlight urges, already funneling strength into Niernen, and he feels the ripple of exhausted gratitude from the iron-queen.

*Their connection is tenuous, flickering with the distance, but Zaniel cannot take them closer. His claws are stuck in the ground, lashed down by his nestmate-oath.* 

*The link strengthens when Michael's consciousness rejoins with Niernen's, and Starlight gasps with relief.

*Good, he thinks to himself, and then it abruptly gets much, much worse.*

*The brown traitor-kin slams into Niernen, battering through her splintering wards and making full contact. Agony spikes through their shaky attachment as bone-sinew-scale crunches sickeningly, and Zaniel feels his own wing throb.*

*"No!" Starlight gasps as Niernen tips away from the beast, her crumpled wing floundering through the air and failing. She starts to plummet, only to be thrown sideways by the vile-orange brute.*

*Their connection shatters as dragon and Rider fall, unable to maintain clear enough thought for a link.*

*Zaniel echoes Starlight's horror as they crash into the hard-rough-earth, Niernen roaring in agony as she thrashes to land on her broken wing, and not on her soft-bone-human Rider.*

*The traitor-kin plunge after the two, but they recoil as if striking a hard-stone-wall before they can converge on the fallen. Iron-shiny-grey magic crackles through the air, repelling them.*

*Niernen's Rider, erecting new wards to defend his bondmate-dragon.*

*"Zani, please," Starlight cries, her misery floating through him, "No one will be here in time— Michael's little boys—"*

*He sinks closer to the ground, pressing even flatter, as her misery clatters against his own. Yes, the little creatures, Niernen-favorites. The smaller one has bright-green-brilliant eyes, like Zaniel's own sparkling scales, and he is fond of the little ones.*

*But he is very, very fond of Starlight, and he had promised blood-kin-nestmate Eldfyrn that he would protect her and her little lights when the lost-ones came.*

*A horrific roar cuts through the sky and, like a terrible vision, a third traitor-kin wings out from beyond the mountains. Too many beasts for human-Rider-Michael to hold off.*

*"Zani," Starlight sobs, hugging his neck, "Please. Are you not the fastest dragon in centuries? We have to get closer— we can help, add wards until the others come— and you are so very fast, you can carry me away if they spot us!"*

*He lifts one paw and then the other, nervous-jittery-scared, but as the beast-dragons slam mercilessly against the wards, Starlight's agony crashes over him.*

***I am very fast***, *he agrees, and springs across the grass, skimming closer to the outrage as his oath-promise shivers and allows him forward.* ***She is still safe here, because I am very, very fast, and she is less-safe-sad if she cannot help.***

*Starlight's relief pours over him, and they venture another few yards, until the faint-flicker-spark is there once more.*

*Niernen's energy is very quiet, very small, almost entirely carried through her bondmate-Rider. And his consciousness is not much brighter.*

*"He can't hold those for much longer," Starlight whispers as they rebound from Michael's thoughts, repelled momentarily before the wards melt around their presence.*

*Pain. So much pain. Pain-agony-exhaustion. Niernen's-Michael can barely acknowledge them, the energy that Starlight starts to desperately channel to him depleting rapidly as the traitor-kin ram and ram into the iron-magic-shield.*

*Zaniel urges over as much energy as he can, pushing it through Starlight to Niernen-and-Michael, but then—*

*—a shuddering ripple of pure agony as Niernen lets out a shrieking roar, rocking through Rider-Zaniel-Starlight as her energy bursts and flares—*

*—and it is just Michael, his wards suddenly strong-iron-holding, but his mind shattering as his bondmate-dragon dies in their place.*

*Starlight recoils, choking out a sob, as she and Zaniel both flinch away from the body-death-horror-agony of Rider-losing-dragon. But they cannot let go, because Starlight's strength is the only thing keeping Niernen's-life-wards together.*

*It is a whirlpool. A flood. Zaniel sinks his claws into the ground and tries to hold on, thrashed around by the confines of Rider-madness as he tries to shield Starlight from it. He must hold it at bay so that she can hold the wards, but it is a horrible thing and he is so very terrified—*

*Starlight's energy dips briefly, and he wants to wing her away to safety before she passes out. But iron-queen-Niernen died for her Rider and they can't let him die now too.*

*The air shifts, distant. Zaniel fears the wards are breaking and tumbling around small-human-Rider, but then there is a glimmer of nestmate-Eldfyrn at the edge of their shared thoughts.*

*Wind sweeps over them, blistering-fast-swift, as gleaming red streaks by overhead. Zaniel feels Starlight's fluttering awareness through her exhaustion, alerted by his own sluggish realization.*

*"Oh, no," she whispers, soft, as her focus waivers and crumbles. Across the plain, the wards crumble with it, shattering around Rider-Michael even as Eldfyrn-and-Raegal hurtle towards the traitor-kin.*

*The traitor-kin roar victoriously, flapping upwards to prepare to dive down, and Zaniel feels nestmate-Eldfyrn touch his thoughts.*

***You kept your oath, darmthrell-elda***, *comes his warm-firm-sure voice,* ***I free you from it. Atra du evarínya ono varda.***

*Zaniel lifts his head, stone-heavy-dread sinking low through him as the three traitor-kin start to dive and blood-red-Eldfyrn streaks to intercept, disconnecting from his thoughts as abruptly as he came.*

*Too late, he feels the realization through Starlight's tired-terrified thoughts. Even they cannot think to defeat three fallen-Rider-traitors and their beast-dragons. Not without using more magic than they can survive.*

*Starlight screams, loud and piercing and horrible, as Eldfyrn-and-Raegal spiral straight into the plunging traitor-kin, shouting their defiance as one.*

*There is a shuddering ripple through the world. Horrible, dark, twisted magic, sucking energy inwards towards its center, before reality tears itself in half.*

*The thunderous detonation is world-rending, throwing Zaniel back. His claws drag through the ground as he braces against the waves and waves of energy, trying not to tumble back onto precious-small-Starlight, as the glowing-hot-white-black center splinters and winks out.*

*When the blinding light crackles and shatters, the sky is clear. The traitor-kin and their lost-Riders are gone, torn from existence, but so are Eldfyrn-and-Raegal. There is only Niernen's crumpled-cold-empty frame and the soft-blinking-weak consciousness of her Rider. 

*Zaniel feels a stunning numb emptiness as Starlight collapses against his neck, her thoughts winking out just as suddenly and terribly.*

---

When Hazel blinks back into her own body, she realizes that she's crying. The tears stream silently as the haunting echo of Zaniel's grief hollows her out. 

So much death. 

She had known, fundamentally, that it must be terrible to feel another die. The mental link is too intimate, too intermingled, the trauma, even second-hand, can only feel real— let alone the death of your *dragon*— 

But she had been wrong. She hadn't even come close to the true, horrifying reality of it. 

So, so much death. 

Zaniel's reaction suddenly makes sense. He had not only seen but *felt* Niernen's death. Had felt Michael experience her death. And he'd lost his own brother, and Raegal, and felt *Cecilé* lose her husband. Death after death after death. 

Hazel has never felt so empty in her life. With clumsy fingers she flips the journal back open, half-blind with her tears, and finds the accursed page. 

She rips it out, rips it in half, and looks up in her grief to see Bastille standing on the threshold, watching her. 

The familiar blue of his eyes cuts through her when she realizes that she had seen the same eyes in Cecilé's face. 

"I'm sorry," she chokes out, too shattered to do much more than try to stifle her sniffles and feel mortified. 

What right did she have, to tear apart his mother's journal out of grief for *his* parents? 

Zaniel is a silent, solemn presence in the shadow of her thoughts, withdrawn from her touch. She shivers with how alone it makes her feel, with Arion still out of reach.

"I'm sorry," she repeats when Bastille takes a slow step forward, "I just— that *horrible* spell—"

"He showed you?" Bastille murmurs, crouching down in front of her. 

Hazel nods, shuddering under his stare, and holds still as he reaches out to gently uncurl her fingers from the shredded page. She releases it, and he pulls the journal away as well, setting it to the side. 

She opens her mouth to apologize again, but with a soft word the paper catches fire. The glimmering black flames consume it quickly in his palm, flooding her with relief, but the sight of the utter darkness makes her think of the black, energy-sucking void. 

A fresh wave of tears escapes her, to her horror, but Bastille doesn't say anything as he lets the flames wink out and leans closer to her. With light fingers he lifts Zaniel's Eldunarí from her lap, brushing his palm over the surface briefly as he looks down at it before he stands back up. 

She doesn't turn to watch as he returns it to its soft pillow for safe-keeping. She just stays frozen in place, staring down at the ground, until Bastille sits down in front of her once more. 

Hazel opens her mouth, but nothing comes out but her own shuddering breaths. She doesn't even know what she would say if she could. 

Smooth fingers curl around her wrists gently, jolting her back into her body, and she goes numbly as Bastille draws her forward. 

The warmth that seeps from him makes her aware of just how cold she is. When he tucks his arms around her, pulling her close, she curls against him and presses her face against the slope of his throat, where his own skin is so warm. 

His fingers ghost up and down her spine gently, a slow rhythm, as he tilts his head against hers. She can feel his pulse against her cheek, steady and constant, and she feels like every beat sends another wave of warmth through her. 

"We call it *eldrvarí hugr*," Bastille says after a while, voice low in the quiet, "Soul-burn. Experiencing a death— it's unnatural, especially for humans. It's a natural magic, but it's not one that our bodies can truly handle. It triggers a sort of shock."

Hazel listens quietly, feeling rung out and exhausted as her pulse slows to match his, nearly sluggish after its earlier pounding. Shock is certainly a word for it: she feels as if the world is slightly fractured, not-quite-right.

"But it will pass," he concludes softly, his hold tightening slightly before relaxing again. "Arion and Octavia are close. His presence will help."

Relief crashes through her, a nearly desperate want radiating in her chest. She's felt so uncomfortable without Arion's comfortable presence, but now it's acute, biting. 

She feels him shift slightly, and then sigh. "I should have warned you. Or— saved the journals for a time when Arion was here. It was short-sighted."

It takes her a moment to realize that he is blaming himself, somehow. Hazel is too tired to be properly surprised, and she just closes her eyes again with a sigh of her own. "No. I pried. I was just— so curious."

///

Her fingers twist in the soft fabric above his heart, feeling his pulse against her palm there, too. It is soothing, though she fears that nothing will ever soothe the terrible ache in her soul.  

"Why did you..." she starts to ask softly, feeling ill at ease at the very thought of the spell. She can't imagine studying it, not after what she has seen, and it seems unfathomable that Bastille would. 

He's silent for a few long seconds, his fingers briefly pausing before resuming their steady rhythm. When he sighs, she feels it acutely, as if it has traveled through his whole body. 

"Energy is startlingly easy to manipulate, once released. And potent," he starts finally, though not with what she is expecting. "Even the smallest blade of grass, once converted to pure energy, can accomplish more than most low grade magicians could. And it doesn't— dissolve. It lingers, ever changed to its purpose. Do you know the dead zone in the Northern Point?"

Hazel nods slightly, picturing the barren stretch of ground that spread inexplicably for several yards in the middle of a great field of green. She and Arion had thought it strange, when they found it. 

"One of the Forsworn died there, and he cursed the ground in death. For centuries, the energy he left behind corrupted the life that tried to grow there, until finally the grass stopped growing entirely. The magic— it shouldn't be able to last beyond the caster's death, but if life is converted to energy, it is a different sort of magic. It is its own force." 

She thinks of the shimmering silver wards that had surrounded Niernen's Rider and realizes that, of course, the dragon's magic should have faded in death. Instead, the wards had only strengthened. Bolstered by her very life's energy, or whatever was left of it. 

"But that spell—" He pauses, then resumes. "It shouldn't work. Not even with so much energy. It's..." It seems like he's struggling to find the words for it, and she thinks of Zaniel saying, I cannot explain. "It's designed to cannibalize energy. It must first convert energy and then consume it to destroy itself, but there's— that's two steps. The conversion would kill the magician before they could then guide it, you see?"

Hazel nods just slightly, feeling the warmth of his skin shift against her cheek. She tucks closer, suddenly reminded of the ice in her veins, and his grip tightens. 

"Eldfyrn never released his Eldunarí," he says finally, coming closer to what she had asked. "His soul died with his body. They severed their connections with both Zaniel and my mother. Michael was barely conscious, and Niernen already dead. Pollux... well. There is no way to know what they actually *did*, because there is no one still alive or sane who could have known." 

After a moment, Hazel whispers, "But I thought Chev has Niernen's Eldunarí?"

"Yes," Bastille agrees after a moment, "But Riders rarely carry their own dragon's Eldunarí on them. Should one or both die, the Eldunarí would likely be lost with them; instead, they are typically kept here, in Doru Araeba. Niernen's Eldunarí was not with Michael when she died, and so she couldn't have seen— not after her body-death."

He must sense the question rising on her tongue, because he doesn't continue. Hazel finally asks tentatively, "And Eldfyrn? Why didn't he..."

***Eldfyrn was a Rider-egg, but he was wild at heart***, Zaniel interjects, voice a low hum in their thoughts, ***He would not be contained, and by-the-by too stubborn to live without his Rider. Starlight would never have agreed to smash his Eldunarí should that come to pass, and so he refused to ever entrust her or anyone else with it.***

He sounds tired, but almost content. She thinks that there is a part of him that, though he has grieved his brother for many years, takes pride in Eldfyrn's choice.

Bastille lets Zaniel's explanation rest without comment, finally continuing when Hazel can think of nothing to say to that other than how sad it is, which she does not. 

"As best as I can tell, the amount of energy to consume three bonded pairs would be more than they could manage. I think they modified the spell, or... expanded the intentions. Maybe it was subconscious, or an act of dragon magic. I think the spell must have first consumed the other dragons' life energy, and, before the exertion could kill them, used my father and Eldfyrn's to trigger the second part— the banishing. But it's— nearly impossible to steal energy like that from another magician, so the spell would have had to overcome the dragons and Riders... Or else all they had to do was guide the spell, and on its own it consumed all of their energy to fuel itself. The point is that it's impossible to know, and should have been impossible to achieve."

Hazel is quiet when he finishes, curling her fingers a little tighter before relaxing them again. She's not sure if he has truly answered her, and she is too afraid of the answer to ask why he had been trying so hard to figure out the mechanics. She doesn't want to lose the little warmth she's gained back.

"I just wanted to understand," he finally says, as if her silence has pulled it out of him, "Holland tells me that my mother died in childbirth, but the elves whisper that it was unusual. Magic should have been enough to save her, yet it did not. It seems my parents had a talent for inexplicable deaths, and at least that spell might have explained one." 

"I'm sorry," she whispers, feeling a sort of empty sorrow as she thinks of the black flames in his palm, of her ripping the fine paper. "I shouldn't have—"

"No," Bastille interrupts, quiet but firm, "You were right. It's a terrible creation, and those notes will never be able to explain it anyway. It's better this way." 

Hazel is silent, listening to his even breathing. She doesn't have it in her to move away, nor does she think she has the energy to stand on her own. She thinks she may die of mortification later, but at the moment he is warm and steady—

Like the sun breaking through clouds, she feels a wave of rightness rush over her as Arion's thoughts reconnect with her own. 

***Hazel!*** he calls, sounding anxious and worried, and she gets the faint impression of he and Octavia winging away from the shore, Arion quickly outstripping the black dragon as he rushes back towards Doru Araeba and Hazel. ***You're cold! Stay there, and I will be there with my flames.***

She feels a smile tug upwards and hides it against Bastille's neck, feeling him shift slightly, no doubt sensing Arion's approach. ***Please don't light anything on fire.***

Arion sniffs, as if her suggestion offensive to his oh-so-delicate sensibilities, and Hazel finally forces herself to loosen her hold. It takes her another moment before she lifts her head, inching back slightly as she looks up at Bastille. 

His gaze flickers across her face and, with a new flood of warmth, she realizes in a belated sort of way how close he is. She can count his freckles, make out every last detail of the blue of his— and his mother's— eyes. 

He lets go of her, reaching up to wipe the tears from her cheeks— first with one hand, then the other, his fingers briefly framing her face before he lets them drop away. She feels the loss acutely.

"Go," he says, not unkindly, nodding towards the winding stairs. 

She hesitates for another moment, but then she feels the faint breeze as Arion shoots by overhead, the force of his great wings making the window cover shake. Overcome by the urgent need to see him, she takes one more glance at Bastille and then she goes, racing down the stairs towards Arion's familiar comfort. 

As she throws herself against his chest, the heat of his scales chases away the lingering frost in her bones, slow and melting. "Oh, Arion, I missed you."

***Not as much as I missed you***, he returns, sounding nearly boastful, and then he curls his great golden mass around her snugly. 

The relief she feels is soul-deep.
