# Dragon
One of the five main races of Alagaësia, dragons only recently returned from near-extinction following the [[Events/Fall of the Dragon Riders\|Fall of the Dragon Riders]]. Their reappearance in Alagaësia is largely assumed to be on account of [[Characters/Eragon II\|Eragon II]] having taken many dragon eggs east to form a new order of [[Races/Dragon Rider\|Riders]]; many believe that the wild dragons that began repopulating [[Locations/Vroengard\|Vroengard]] must have flown from the east. 

[[Locations/Vroengard\|Vroengard]] seems to be the only natural habitat for the dragons. It is the only place where the wild dragons nest, as well as the stronghold for the [[Races/Dragon Rider\|Riders]] and their dragons. Any eggs that appear outside of [[Locations/Vroengard\|Vroengard]] can be attributed to the [[Library/Ambassador\|Ambassadors]] who occasionally ferry them between races and those that have been stolen by the [[Characters/King Pirphal\|Sorcerer King]]. 

## Magic
Dragons are beings of pure [[Library/Magic\|magic]], similar to the [[Races/Werecat\|Werecats]], which is possibly why the two races seem to form such close bonds. Not only are dragons capable of providing great amounts of energy to magicians and [[Races/Dragon Rider\|Riders]], but they are also capable of bouts of inexplicable magic. Dragons have been known to accomplish great, impossible feats on account of this magic, but they are not able to control when sure feats occur. 

## Eldunarí
Dragons contain a "heart of hearts," also known as an [[Library/Eldunarí\|Eldunarí]]. It is considered the soul of the dragon, to an extent, and can store their consciousness both in life and in death. 

## Life-Cycle
Dragons are ready to hatch very shortly after their eggs are laid. Those that are given to the [[Races/Dragon Rider\|Riders]] are considered "Rider eggs," which the dragons are able to sense are destined for a particular [[Races/Dragon Rider\|Rider]]. Those eggs will remain in stasis for as long as it takes for them to find that [[Races/Dragon Rider\|Rider]]. Wild eggs, in contrast, typically hatch within a week or two.

Dragons once hatched grow very rapidly. They are about the size of a kitten, or sometimes a younger house cat, when hatched. Within a month, they are typically large enough to carry a [[Races/Dragon Rider\|Rider]] or two in flight. They never truly stop growing; a dragon will continue to grow for as long as they live, with the eldest of dragons also being the largest. The gain the ability to breathe fire around six months.
