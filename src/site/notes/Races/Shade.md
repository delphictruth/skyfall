# Shade
Shades are creatures of dark [[Library/Magic\|magic]], born when a magician summons spirits and looses control over them; the spirits possess the magician in turn, taking over their body and turning the magician into a Shade. Shades are nearly as powerful as the [[Races/Elves\|elves]], with heightened strength and speed and a frightening array of magic at their disposal. They are incredibly hard to kill, and may only be killed by being stabbed through the heart — which will free the spirits and kill the magician. 

Very few have ever survived an encounter with a Shade. This is partially due to their rarity, but also because of how difficult they are to kill, even for an [[Races/Elves\|elf]] or a [[Races/Dragon Rider\|Rider]]. It is said that the act of killing a Shade might even kill the killer, because the blow-back of the spirits escaping can be a horrible experience wherein the spirits may try to consume the killer or steal their body. 

Given the near-impossibiltiy of the feat, those who kill a Shade are typically named Shadeslayer. In [[Library/Dwarvish\|Dwarvish]], they are referred to as Hrethcarach (a literal translation of "shadeslayer").
