# First Rider Rebellion
>666–667 ABRW

Launched in 666 ABRW, when [[Characters/Raegal Darkstar\|Raegal Darkstar]] led the [[Characters/King Pirphal\|Sorcerer King]]'s order of Riders against the [[Groups/New Rider Order\|New Rider Order]]. It is considered a rebellion and not a purely external attack because he recruited several other Riders from the [[Groups/New Rider Order\|Order]] as well. 

The goal seemed to be to seize control of [[Locations/Vroengard\|Vroengard]], such that [[Characters/King Pirphal\|King Pirphal]] could station his own Riders there and ultimately convert the remainder of the Order to his cause as well. 

Although they did not call themselves such originally, those who defected from the Order — and those who were never in the Order to begin with — were referred to as the [[Groups/Fallen Riders\|Fallen Riders]]. 

The Rebellion concluded in 667 ABRW. In the last battle, [[Characters/Raegal Darkstar\|Raegal Darkstar]] and [[Dragons/Eldfyrn\|Eldfyrn]] managed to kill [[Characters/Indigo Shadeslayer\|Indigo Shadeslayer]] before being captured themselves. The majority of the [[Groups/Fallen Riders\|Fallen Riders]] were defeated or driven off.
