# Du Namar Aurboda
>The Banishing of the Names

"The Banishing of the Names" refers to the event that occurred during the [[Events/Fall of the Dragon Riders\|Fall of the Dragon Riders]]. 

When the dragons realized that the thirteen dragons of the [[Groups/Forsworn\|Forsworn]] had betrayed them and that they were trying to exterminate the entire dragon race, the dragons became enraged. The entire dragon race combined their powers and in one of their inexplicable feats of [[Library/Magic\|Magic]], stripped the Forsworn's dragons of their names and their ability to describe themselves. This included all names, birth names, [[Library/True Names\|true names]], titles, thus they could not even call themselves dragons.
