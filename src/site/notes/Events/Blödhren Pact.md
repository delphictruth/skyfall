# Blödhren Pact
>5305 AC originally, 1 ABRW addition

The magical binding between [[Races/Dragon\|dragons]] and potential [[Races/Dragon Rider\|Riders]]. Originally, the Pact was formed to end [[Events/Du Fyrn Skulblaka\|Du Fyrn Skulblaka]] and only included the [[Races/Elves\|elves]] and [[Races/Human\|humans]]. It is said that the magic inherent to the Pact gradually improved all three races: dragons gained speech, elves developed stronger magic, and humans advanced as a society. After the conclusion of the [[Events/Rider War\|Rider War]], [[Races/Urgals\|urgals]] and [[Races/Dwarves\|dwarves]] were added to the Pact such as to bring equality among the races. 

The Pact is celebrated by the elves in the [[Locations/Agaetí Blödhren\|Agaetí Blödhren]].
