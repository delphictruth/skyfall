# Broddring Kingdom
>Also known as the Broddring Empire under King Galbatorix

After the conclusion of the [[Events/Rider War\|Rider War]] in 1 ABRW, the Broddring Empire was restored to the Kingdom under the rule of [[Characters/Queen Nasuada\|Queen Nasuada]]. While this brought the Kingdom into an era of peace and prosperity, it also marked a new level of control over [[Library/Magic\|magic]] and magicians. It is said that this heightened level of regulation is the reason that [[Characters/Eragon II\|Eragon II]] chose to head east to create his new [[Races/Dragon Rider\|Rider]] order.
