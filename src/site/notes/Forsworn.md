# Forsworn
>The thirteen followers of Galbatorix

The Forsworn ("Wyrdfell" in the [[Ancient Language|Ancient Language]]) were the [[Dragon Rider|Riders]] who followed and aided [[Galbatorix|Galbatorix]]. There were 13 in total, though all were dead by the time of the [[Rider War|Rider War]]. 

At one point the [[Dragon|dragons]] acted together in a great display of wild magic to trigger [[Du Namar Aurboda|Du Namar Aurboda]], or the Banishing of the Names. For that reason, all of the names of the Forsworn's dragons are lost from history and impossible to say or recall.
