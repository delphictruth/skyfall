# Broddring Kingdom
The Kingdom is technically a monarchy, but the ruling powers of the major cities are members of a Council with some voting authority on major reforms. They are formally considered mayors so to speak, with varying styles of governance; most mayorships are vaguely hereditary in nature, with certain Houses (remnants of the Empire's nobility) controlling the cities for generations. The Council was formally imposed in 250 ABRW. 

There are no true titles, or at least there are not very many formal titles in the Kingdom beyond the Monarch. Most positions of power are generically referred to a Lord or Lady; family members might also be referred to as such, regardless of their own connections or status.

## Kingdom | Ilirea
As the capital city, [[Locations/Ilirea\|Ilirea]] is ruled not by a mayor but by the monarchy itself. The Council is technically headquarted in Ilirea, with major meetings requiring the mayors to travel to the capital for a vote. Otherwise, there are some standard politicians always stationed in the capital to handle local politics. The Kingdom's military force is also concentrated in Ilirea, with their General and Commanders generally being considered political powers of sorts.

## Teirm
[[Locations/Teirm\|Teirm]] is the primary port city and hosts the Kingom's navy. 

## Dras-Leona
[[Locations/Dras-Leona\|Dras-Leona]] is considered the religious center of the Kingdom. Their mayorship is typically less hereditary in nature, with the mayor usually doubling as the Head of the Church. For example, [[Characters/Lord Wilhelm\|Lord Wilhelm]] was both mayor and Head, elected with no relation to the prior mayor. Following his term, Dras-Leona came under the power of House Erebus, with the current Head of House Erebus acting as mayor.

## Belatona
[[Locations/Belatona\|Belatona]] is a major craftsman city and considered an artistic hub in the Kingdom. It is under the control of House Aeron, the current mayor being [[Characters/Lord Blake Aeron\|Lord Blake Aeron]]. Following [[Characters/Gabriel Aeron\|Gabriel Aeron]]'s death, [[Characters/Benjamin Aeron\|Benjamin Aeron]] is considered the heir of House Aeron and Belatona's seat on the Council.

# Elves
The [[Races/Elves\|elves]] are ruled by a non-hereditary monarchy, though power does tend to pass from parent to child. There are several "noble" families among the elves, though it is a very informal sort of nobility. Families might reach distinction through relation to former monarchs, control over a city, or simply through "potential" as the next monarch.
