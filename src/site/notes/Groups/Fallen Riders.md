# Fallen Riders
>The King's Riders

The Fallen originated with a select group of [[Races/Dragon Rider\|Dragon Riders]] that were trained by [[Characters/King Pirphal\|King Pirphal]] in [[Locations/Surda\|Surda]]. Notably, these Riders were never a part of the [[Groups/New Rider Order\|New Rider Order]] and therefore were considered a private force under his control. 

It is said that [[Characters/King Pirphal\|King Pirphal]] conducted many magical experiments on them, trying to create a "better" race of Riders and to find a way to harness the stange magic of the [[Races/Dragon\|dragons]]. Supposedly, he even went so far as to try to turn one of his Riders into a [[Races/Shade\|Shade]], but the result was catastrophic and both Rider and dragon were lost. 

This force was later merged with those that defected from the [[Groups/New Rider Order\|New Rider Order]], after [[Characters/King Pirphal\|King Pirphal]] recruited [[Characters/Raegal Darkstar\|Raegal Darkstar]] to train his remaining Riders. This is when they started to be referred to as the Fallen Riders, though they had originally be called the "King's Riders".

The dragons tend to call them "lost ones" or "Lost Riders". This name has also been adopted and been used interchangeably by some of the Riders. Others refer to them as the [[Groups/Forsworn\|Forsworn]] reborn.
