# New Rider Order
Established in 350 ABRW under [[Characters/Indigo Shadeslayer\|Indigo Shadeslayer]] and [[Dragons/Echo Stealthwalker\|Echo Stealthwalker]]. While it was modeled after the fallen [[Groups/Rider Order\|Rider Order]] of old, it also features many improvements and changes. Notably, [[Races/Dwarves\|dwarves]] and [[Races/Urgals\|urgals]] are now included within the [[Events/Blödhren Pact\|Blödhren Pact]] and therefore members of the Order.
