# Forsworn
>The thirteen followers of Galbatorix

The Forsworn ("Wyrdfell" in the [[Library/Ancient Language\|Ancient Language]]) were the [[Races/Dragon Rider\|Riders]] who followed and aided [[Characters/Galbatorix\|Galbatorix]]. There were 13 in total, though all were dead by the time of the [[Events/Rider War\|Rider War]]. 

At one point the [[Races/Dragon\|dragons]] acted together in a great display of wild magic to trigger [[Events/Du Namar Aurboda\|Du Namar Aurboda]], or the Banishing of the Names. For that reason, all of the names of the Forsworn's dragons are lost from history and impossible to say or recall.
