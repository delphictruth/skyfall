# King's Sorcerers
An elite band of sorcerers and magicians in personal service to [[Characters/King Pirphal\|King Pirphal]]. They are trained by the King. The [[Groups/New Rider Order\|Order]] suspects that the original contingent of sorcerers were those that the King failed to have a dragon egg hatch for, and thus the "failed" recruits for the [[Groups/Fallen Riders\|Fallen Riders]]. Later they were known to help hunt for other magicians and potential Riders to bring before the King, and they still fulfill that role in [[Locations/Surda\|Surda]]. 

While they were seen as secondary to the [[Groups/Fallen Riders\|Fallen Riders]], since the [[Events/Second Rider Rebellion\|Second Rider Rebellion]] and the subsequent elimination of most of the [[Groups/Fallen Riders\|Fallen Riders]], the King's Sorcerers have become both more numerous and more valued by the King. 

They typically wear black and gold robes, with rather prominent golden crests marking their service to the King. Publicly, they are seen as guardians of the kingdom but feared nonetheless. Those who know better know that they are ruthless hunters, willing to do much to help their King in his pursuit of twisted magic â€” and many are subjects of his magical experiments themselves.
