# Hagatha
>The secret sorceress

[[Characters/Hazel Goldenblood\|Hazel Goldenblood]]'s mother. There is not much known about her past or circumstances, but she was once one of the [[Groups/King's Sorcerers\|King's Sorcerers]] and later the King's mistress. She left shortly after she became pregnant, well aware that her child may become a subject for his magical experiments if she stayed. Although she did not go far, and indeed stayed within Surda, it is unclear if the King ever knew where she was and left her in peace willingly or if her own magic managed to shield her presence from him. It was her magic that concealed the true color of [[Characters/Hazel Goldenblood\|Hazel Goldenblood]]'s blood, with her spells wearing off after Hazel left home and flew too far for the magic to shield her.
