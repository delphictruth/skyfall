## History
Cecilé's existence is somewhat puzzling to the outside observer, given her father's happy relationship with [[Characters/Iasis Dröttning\|Iasis Dröttning]]. However, elven children are exceedingly rare, and the Queen was never able to have another after [[Characters/Holland Dröttningu\|Holland Dröttningu]]. It is said that [[Characters/Iasis Dröttning\|Iasis Dröttning]] herself arranged for [[Characters/Melody Rosesinger\|Melody Rosesinger]] to act as a surrogate, though ultimately Celicé was treated more like a neice than a foster-daughter by the Queen. 

A few years after her elder sister departed for [[Locations/Doru Araeba\|Doru Araeba]], Cecilé pledged herself as an Ambassador and took on the [[Library/Yawë\|Yawë]]. She followed Holland to [[Locations/Vroengard\|Vroengard]] and there befriended many of the young Riders. 

Ceclié was never a [[Races/Dragon Rider\|Rider]] herself, but she had a strange relationship with the wild dragons of Vroengard. She was the only person known to be able to approach them without issue, and she spent a lot of time among them forging close friendships and singing for them. On occasion, she even delivered some of the Rider eggs back to the [[Groups/New Rider Order\|Order]] on behalf of the wild dragons, which many believed to be a sign of great trust. This is how she befriended the wild dragon, [[Dragons/Zaniel\|Zaniel]], among others.

It is on account of her natural affinity for the dragons that she was able to earn the trust of the then-captive [[Dragons/Eldfyrn\|Eldfyrn]]. Although she had known [[Characters/Raegal Darkstar\|Raegal Darkstar]] and [[Dragons/Eldfyrn\|Eldfyrn]] prior to the [[Events/First Rider Rebellion\|First Rider Rebellion]], their relationships truly blossomed during their imprisonment. Cecilé visited Eldfyrn every day, keeping him company and speaking to him until he finally began to acknowledge her, and it was through her kindness to his dragon that she managed to reach Raegal. Most credit her with Raegal and Eldfyrn eventually achieving rehabilitation and sharing all that they knew about the [[Characters/King Pirphal\|Sorcerer King]]. It was rather shortly after their release that Cecilé and Raegal were married.
