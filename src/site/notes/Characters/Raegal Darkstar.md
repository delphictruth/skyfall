# Raegal Darkstar
>Agent of fate

Raegal was a 31 year old [[Races/Human\|Human]] [[Races/Dragon Rider\|Rider]], bonded with [[Dragons/Eldfyrn\|Eldfyrn]].

Perhaps equally as infamously, he was also the only [[Groups/Fallen Riders\|Fallen Rider]] to *rejoin* the [[Groups/New Rider Order\|Order]] and ultimately died with his dragon defending [[Locations/Vroengard\|Vroengard]] during the [[Events/Second Rider Rebellion\|Second Rider Rebellion]].
