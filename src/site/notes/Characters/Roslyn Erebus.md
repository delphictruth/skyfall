# Roslyn Erebus
>Run-away Heiress 

Roslyn is a 17 year old [[Races/Human\|human]] [[Races/Dragon Rider\|Rider]], bonded with [[Dragons/Fëon\|Fëon]]. She is the young Heiress of House Erebus, the current ruling authority in [[Locations/Dras-Leona\|Dras-Leona]], but seems to have an extremely fraught relationship with her father, [[Characters/Lord Erebus\|Lord Erebus]]. She typically describes herself as being self-disowned, but is still referred to as a Lady of Dras-Leona and the Erebus Heiress. Fortunately, those issues are essentially behind her as a [[Races/Dragon Rider\|Rider]].

## History
As the *only* child of either [[Characters/Lord Erebus\|Lord Erebus]] or [[Characters/Erebus\|Erebus]], Roslyn is by default the last Heir to House Erebus. This is likely why many, including her father, still consider her the Erebus Heiress despite her disavowment. It is unlikely that she will ever take responsibility of the House, nor pursue Dras-Leona's mayorship, so it is largely an empty title.
