# Hadrian
>Brother of the King

Hadrian is the elder brother of [[Characters/King Pirphal\|King Pirphal]], though he is not commonly known within [[Locations/Surda\|Surda]] or beyond. He is something of a mystery, with many uncertain if the King actually has a brother at all or if he is just a rumor.
