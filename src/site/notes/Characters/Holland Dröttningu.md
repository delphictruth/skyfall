# Holland Dröttningu
>Princess of the Elves

Holland is a 63 year old [[Races/Elves\|elf]], and the daughter of the [[Races/Elves\|elven]] Queen [[Characters/Iasis Dröttning\|Iasis Dröttning]]. Although the elves do not formally recognize a hereditary monarchy, nor is Holland technically a "princess" by their standards, she is nevertheless treated as such and referred to as Drottningu by the elves. She moved to [[Locations/Vroengard\|Vroengard]] to be with [[Characters/Cain Dreamwalker\|Cain Dreamwalker]], and is responsible for finding and returning him to both his sanity and the [[Groups/New Rider Order\|Order]] after the death of his dragon. 

Her younger half-sister, [[Characters/Cecilé Dragonsong\|Cecilé Dragonsong]], was inspired by her choice and volunteered as an [[Library/Ambassador\|Ambassador]] to [[Locations/Vroengard\|Vroengard]] in order to be near to Holland once more. 

Although she is not a [[Races/Dragon Rider\|Rider]] herself, she has been closely involved with the [[Groups/New Rider Order\|New Rider Order]] and therefore is a source of knowledge for the younger [[Races/Dragon Rider\|Riders]]. She often attends lessons with [[Characters/Cain Dreamwalker\|Cain Dreamwalker]]. 

She is also considered on the greatest elven healers and, by extension, one of the greatest healers in the modern era.
