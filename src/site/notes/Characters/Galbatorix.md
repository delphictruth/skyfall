# Galbatorix
>King of the Broddring Empire

The infamous King of the [[Locations/Broddring Empire\|Broddring Empire]], otherwise known as the [[Races/Dragon Rider\|Rider]] who led the [[Groups/Forsworn\|Forsworn]] and triggered the [[Events/Fall of the Dragon Riders\|Fall of the Dragon Riders]]. 

While his dragon is recorded as Shruikan, his true bondmate was Jarnunv√∂sk, who was killed in combat. Shruikan was the dragon of another Rider that Galbatorix killed. The King stole Shruikan and forced him into an unnatural bond, which the [[Races/Elves\|elves]] called a "mockery" of a true Rider-bond. 

He was defeated at the end of the [[Events/Rider War\|Rider War]].
