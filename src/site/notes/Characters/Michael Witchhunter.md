## History
Notably, the [[Races/Werecat\|Werecat]] [[Characters/Gwin the Werecat\|Gwin the Werecat]] once told him that he would kill the witch who had cursed his family. The [[Races/Werecat\|Werecats]] began to call him Witchhunter, making it one of his more prominent names, but he never actually came to kill the witch. It is said that he died before fate could be fulfilled.
