# Gwin the Werecat
>The Riders' Werecat

Gwin is a relatively young [[Races/Werecat\|Werecat]], which is still ancient by the standards of most other races. He was known to be [[Characters/Cecilé Dragonsong\|Cecilé Dragonsong]]'s companion and, following her death, has lurked close to her son [[Characters/Bastille Soulkeeper\|Bastille Soulkeeper]]. He doesn't quite live in [[Locations/Doru Araeba\|Doru Araeba]], or at least does not stay with the [[Races/Dragon Rider\|Riders]] full time; he spends much of his time with the wild dragons instead, and frequently disappears with no explanation for his absences. He typically appears as a large, shaggy brown cat, but occasionally he appears as a scraggly-looking boy. 

Many of his kin call him the "[[Races/Dragon Rider\|Riders]]' Werecat" for his decision to live so closely to the [[Groups/New Rider Order\|Order]] and his frequent foretellings around the [[Races/Dragon Rider\|Riders]] there. For instance, he has foretold futures for [[Characters/Cecilé Dragonsong\|Cecilé Dragonsong]], [[Characters/Michael Witchhunter\|Michael Witchhunter]], [[Characters/Bastille Soulkeeper\|Bastille Soulkeeper]], [[Characters/Hazel Goldenblood\|Hazel Goldenblood]], and several others.
