# Eragon I
>The First Dragon Rider


His [[Library/Rider's sword\|Rider's sword]] was originally called Islingr (light-bringer). It later became Head of the Order [[Characters/Vrael\|Vrael]]'s sword, and finally it was stolen by [[Characters/Galbatorix\|Galbatorix]] when he killed [[Characters/Vrael\|Vrael]]. When [[Characters/Galbatorix\|Galbatorix]] took it, he renamed the sword [[Swords/Vrangr\|Vrangr]].
