# Rider's sword
All [[Dragon Rider|Riders]] receive their own specially crafted sword from the elven smith, [[Rhunön|Rhunön]], generally at the end of the their first phase of training. They are peerless weapons and quite distinctive. 

These blades are made from [[Brightsteel|brightsteel]] and will never break, scratch, or dull. They are also immune to magical attacks and can cut through or bypass magic. They cut through most other metals and materials with ease. 

The blades of these swords are made to match the scales of the Rider's [[Dragon|dragon]], and have a slightly translucent look to them. They all have a gemstone in the hilt that matches the blade as well, for Riders to store energy in. The hilt itself and design of the blade are determined by the personality of the Rider, however. Each one is designed to be a perfect match to their body and fighting style. They are all named, and bear the [[Glyph|glyph]] of their name on the blade, in the [[Ancient Language|Ancient Language]].
