# Ambassador
The various races traditionally have Ambassadors to represent them to the [[Races/Dragon Rider\|Riders]] on [[Locations/Vroengard\|Vroengard]]. They may also be dispatched to speak with the other races as well, such as an [[Races/Elves\|elven]] Ambassador being sent to [[Locations/Tronjheim\|Tronjheim]]. 

They are also at times responsible for ferrying [[Races/Dragon\|dragon]] eggs back to their people, such as to help look for their chosen [[Races/Dragon Rider\|Riders]], but that role has largely returned to the [[Groups/New Rider Order\|New Rider Order]]. 

#### Recorded Ambassadors
