# Indlvarn
If a [[Races/Dragon\|dragon]] experiences bodily death and flees into its [[Library/Eldunarí\|Eldunarí]] while their [[Races/Dragon Rider\|Rider]] still lives, together they become known as Indlvarn. The transition is hardly a pleasant one for the dragon, but many Riders and dragons successfully adapt to the change and continue to serve the Riders with distinction.

#### Recorded Indlvarn
