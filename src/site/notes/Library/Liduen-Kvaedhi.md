# Liduen-Kvaedhi
>The "poetic script" of the Ancient Language

The [[Library/Ancient Language\|Ancient Language]] can be written in a transcribed form, using the human's runes, but it is originally written in glyphs. The glyph form is referred to as Liduen-Kvaedhi and comprised of 28 different unique parts, which can be combined in any number of ways to create the appropriate glyph for a word. As such, each glyph represents a whole word, not an individual letter.
