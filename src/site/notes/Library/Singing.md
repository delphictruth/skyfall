# Singing
The [[Races/Elves\|Elves]] are known for their ability to weave [[Library/Magic\|Magic]] through song. While they do have many ordinary songs, and singing is a typical practice in other races, in this context it is a form of spell-casting. Users will sing their spells in the [[Library/Ancient Language\|Ancient Language]], a practice that is said to weave the magic more fluidly. It can also be used to increase concentration for longer and more complicated spells.
