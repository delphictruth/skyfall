# Yawë
The Yawë is an [[Races/Elves\|elven]] [[Library/Liduen-Kvaedhi\|glyph]] representing the Ancient Language for "bond of trust". It acts as such a bond. It is said that the elven Queen or King might bestow certain gifts to [[Library/Elf-friends\|Elf-friends]] bearing the Yawë symbol, such that all elves will recognize their status. [[Library/Ambassador\|Ambassadors]] from [[Locations/Ellesméra\|Ellesméra]] also take on the Yawë symbol when they pledge themselves to the Queen's service, having it tattooed somewhere on their body.
