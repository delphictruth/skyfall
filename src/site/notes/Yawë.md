# Yawë
The Yawë is an [[Elves|elven]] [[Glyph|glyph]] representing the Ancient Language for "bond of trust". It acts as such a bond. It is said that the elven Queen or King might bestow certain gifts to [[Elf-friends|Elf-friends]] bearing the Yawë symbol, such that all elves will recognize their status. [[Ambassador|Ambassadors]] from [[Ellesméra|Ellesméra]] also take on the Yawë symbol when they pledge themselves to the Queen's service, having it tattooed somewhere on their body.
