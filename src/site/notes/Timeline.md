**700 ABRW** — SKYFALL

[^1]: A note on time: The calendar year 0 AC, or After Creation (according to the dwarves), is the equivalent to the year 8000 BBRW (Before the Beginning of the Rider War). The humans typically use the dwarvish calendar. 
[^2]: Similarly, the calendar year 8000 AC is the equivalent of the year 1 ABRW (After the Beginning of the Rider War). This calendar is used by the Rider Order.
[^3]: This was unintentional, but I think it's too fitting not to keep it.
