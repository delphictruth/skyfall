# Blödhren Pact
>5305 AC originally, 1 ABRW addition

The magical binding between [[Dragon|dragons]] and potential [[Dragon Rider|Riders]]. Originally, the Pact was formed to end [[Du Fyrn Skulblaka|Du Fyrn Skulblaka]] and only included the [[Elves|elves]] and [[Human|humans]]. It is said that the magic inherent to the Pact gradually improved all three races: dragons gained speech, elves developed stronger magic, and humans advanced as a society. After the conclusion of the [[Rider War|Rider War]], [[Urgals|urgals]] and [[Dwarves|dwarves]] were added to the Pact such as to bring equality among the races. 

The Pact is celebrated by the elves in the [[Agaetí Blödhren|Agaetí Blödhren]].
