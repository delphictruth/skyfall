# Melody Rosesinger
>The esteemed poet

Melody was a [[Human|human]] artist who was invited to live in [[Ellesméra|Ellesméra]] among the [[Elves|elves]] on account of her great talent for [[Singing|sung]] [[Magic|magic]] and poetry. She was particularly well-known for her affinity for roses, which she tended to sing into place in the most unusual places. Her home was always strewn with roses, growing out of the trees. 

She is also notable for having been asked by Queen [[Iasis Dröttning|Iasis Dröttning]] to act as a surrogate, given Iasis' inability to have children after [[Holland Dröttningu|Holland Dröttningu]]. Seeing as Melody was both human and already acknowledged by the elves for her talents, she seemed the appropriate choice. As such, Melody carried [[Byron Könungr|Byron Könungr]]'s daughter, [[Cecilé Dragonsong|Cecilé Dragonsong]], but ended up raising her mostly herself when she was too attached to give up full care of her. Instead, [[Iasis Dröttning|Iasis Dröttning]] and [[Byron Könungr|Byron Könungr]] treated [[Cecilé Dragonsong|Cecilé Dragonsong]] more as a niece than a foster-daughter, leaving her largely in Melody's care.
