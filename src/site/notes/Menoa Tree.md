# Menoa Tree
>The Forest Maiden

The Menoa Tree is a gigantic tree in the elven forest, [[Du Weldenvarden|Du Weldenvarden]], where the elves celebrate the [[Agaetí Blödhren|Agaetí Blödhren]] (Blood-Oath Celebration). Its roots span an area of about 10 acres, while the trunk is thicker than a hundred of the smaller trees of the forest combined.

Once upon a time, the Menoa Tree was an elven maiden named Linnëa. It is said that upon discovering her lover with another, she killed them both and fled into the trees that she held dear. She was so filled with grief and guilt that she spent three days and three nights [[Singing|singing]] herself into the oldest tree of the forest.
