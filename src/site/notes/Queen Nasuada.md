# Queen Nasuada
>High Queen of Alagaësia

Nasuada was the former leader of the Varden and chosen to take the throne following [[Galbatorix|Galbatorix]]'s defeat. While she was considered a just ruler, she also introduced new regulations and control over [[Magic|magic]] — to an extent that many believed that she had stifled magical development in the [[Broddring Empire|Broddring Kingdom]] for years.
