# Indlvarn
If a [[Dragon|dragon]] experiences bodily death and flees into its [[Eldunarí|Eldunarí]] while their [[Dragon Rider|Rider]] still lives, together they become known as Indlvarn. The transition is hardly a pleasant one for the dragon, but many Riders and dragons successfully adapt to the change and continue to serve the Riders with distinction.

**Known Indlvarn**
- [[Cain Dreamwalker|Cain Dreamwalker]] & [[Kveykva|Kveykva]]
- [[Michael|Michael]] & [[Niernen|Niernen]] (*former*)
- [[Indigo|Indigo]] & [[Echo|Echo]] (*former*)
