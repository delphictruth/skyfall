# Glyph
>Forms of the Ancient Language

The [[Ancient Language|Ancient Language]] can be written in a transcribed form, using the human's runes, but it is originally written in glyphs. These glyphs are comprised of 28 different unique parts, which can be combined in any number of ways to create the appropriate glyph for a word. As such, each glyph represents a whole word, not an individual letter.
