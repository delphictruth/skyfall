After their defeat in the [[First Rider Rebellion|First Rider Rebellion]] and the capture of their commander, the remaining [[Fallen Riders|Fallen Riders]] returned to [[Surda|Surda]] and essentially disappeared. 

However, the [[King Pirphal|Sorcerer King]] worked in secret to restore those who remained to prior and even greater strength. He was also able to pair several more eggs with new Riders, regrowing their forces. 

Thus, twelve years after they were defeated the first time, the [[Fallen Riders|Fallen Riders]] returned and launched the Second Rider Rebellion.
