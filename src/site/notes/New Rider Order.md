# New Rider Order
Established in 350 ABRW under [[Indigo|Indigo]] and [[Echo|Echo]]. While it was modeled after the fallen [[Rider Order|Rider Order]] of old, it also features many improvements and changes. Notably, [[Dwarves|dwarves]] and [[Urgals|urgals]] are now included within the [[Blödhren Pact|Blödhren Pact]] and therefore members of the Order.
