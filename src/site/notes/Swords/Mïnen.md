# Mïnen
Mïnen ("disease") is the name of [[Characters/Isaak Bondbreaker\|Isaak Bondbreaker]]'s sword, which was designed and styled to appear as a [[Library/Rider's sword\|Rider's sword]]. Because he had not yet completed his training when he defected, he did not have his own sword; he had to have one made, and tried to recreate the Riders' swords, even going as far as to color it like his dragon and give it a proper name. However, it lacked the [[Races/Elves\|elven]] enchantments and wasn't as sharp or as strong, nor capable of cutting through magic. 

The [[Races/Dragon Rider\|Riders]] called it a perverse mockery of a sword, and far worse.
