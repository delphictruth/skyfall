# Vrangr
Vrangr ("awry") is a [[Library/Rider's sword\|Rider's sword]] with a long history. It was originally named Islingr ("light-bringer") and was [[Characters/Eragon I\|Eragon I]]'s sword â€” and, for that matter, the very first [[Library/Rider's sword\|Rider's sword]] to ever be created. It later passed to another Head of the Old Order, [[Characters/Vrael\|Vrael]], and was finally stolen from Vrael when he was killed in the [[Events/Fall of the Dragon Riders\|Fall of the Dragon Riders]] by [[Characters/Galbatorix\|Galbatorix]]. Under [[Characters/Galbatorix\|Galbatorix]]'s ownership, it became known as Vrangr and even underwent a strange change in color. 

[[Characters/Hazel Goldenblood\|Hazel Goldenblood]]'s own [[Library/Rider's sword\|Rider's sword]] is inadvertently named after it, or rather named after its original form.
