# Grimm the Elder
>The wisest of dragons

Grimm was a wild dragon, born on [[Locations/Vroengard\|Vroengard]] well before the [[Events/Fall of the Dragon Riders\|Fall of the Dragon Riders]]. He was one of the [[Library/Eldunarí\|Eldunarí]] that was hidden there, and one of the few that chose to remain in [[Locations/Doru Araeba\|Doru Araeba]] after [[Characters/Eragon II\|Eragon II]] departed [[Locations/Alagaësia\|Alagaësia]]. It is said that he remained to keep watch and provide guidance, should a new [[Races/Dragon Rider\|Rider]] order revive on the island. As such, he is utterly ancient, and he was already old when he released his Eldunarí. 

After the eventual return of the [[Races/Dragon Rider\|Riders]] and the [[Groups/New Rider Order\|New Rider Order]], he traveled with many pairs of dragons and Riders across Alagaësia and, sometimes, beyond. He has seen much and has a cast collection of memories, knowledge, and stories. He is considered the wisest of the [[Library/Eldunarí\|Eldunarya]] on [[Locations/Vroengard\|Vroengard]]. 

His Eldunarí is large, though small than one might expect given his total age. It is a pale green gem. Currently, [[Characters/Bastille Soulkeeper\|Bastille Soulkeeper]] has possession of it.
