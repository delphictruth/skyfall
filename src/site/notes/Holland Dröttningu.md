# Holland Dröttningu
>Princess of the Elves

Holland is a 63 year old [[Elves|elf]], and the daughter of the [[Elves|elven]] Queen [[Iasis Dröttning|Iasis Dröttning]]. Although the elves do not formally recognize a hereditary monarchy, nor is Holland technically a "princess" by their standards, she is nevertheless treated as such and referred to as Drottningu by the elves. She moved to [[Vroengard|Vroengard]] to be with [[Cain Dreamwalker|Cain Dreamwalker]], and is responsible for finding and returning him to both his sanity and the [[New Rider Order|Order]] after the death of his dragon. 

Her younger half-sister, [[Cecilé Dragonsong|Cecilé Dragonsong]], was inspired by her choice and volunteered as an [[Ambassador|Ambassador]] to [[Vroengard|Vroengard]] in order to be near to Holland once more. 

Although she is not a [[Dragon Rider|Rider]] herself, she has been closely involved with the [[New Rider Order|New Rider Order]] and therefore is a source of knowledge for the younger [[Dragon Rider|Riders]]. She often attends lessons with [[Cain Dreamwalker|Cain Dreamwalker]]. 

She is also considered on the greatest elven healers and, by extension, one of the greatest healers in the modern era.
