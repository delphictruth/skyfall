# Ambassador
The various races traditionally have Ambassadors to represent them to the [[Dragon Rider|Riders]] on [[Vroengard|Vroengard]]. They may also be dispatched to speak with the other races as well, such as an [[Elves|elven]] Ambassador being sent to [[Tronjheim|Tronjheim]]. 

They are also at times responsible for ferrying [[Dragon|dragon]] eggs back to their people, such as to help look for their chosen [[Dragon Rider|Riders]], but that role has largely returned to the [[New Rider Order|New Rider Order]]. 

**Known Ambassadors**
- [[Cecilé|Cecilé]], [[Elves|elven]] ambassador to the [[Dragon Rider|Riders]]
