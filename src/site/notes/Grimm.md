# Grimm
>The wisest of dragons

Grimm was a wild dragon, born on [[Vroengard|Vroengard]] well before the [[Fall of the Dragon Riders|Fall of the Dragon Riders]]. He was one of the [[Eldunarí|Eldunarí]] that was hidden there, and one of the few that chose to remain in [[Doru Araeba|Doru Araeba]] after [[Eragon II|Eragon II]] departed [[Alagaësia|Alagaësia]]. It is said that he remained to keep watch and provide guidance, should a new [[Dragon Rider|Rider]] order revive on the island. As such, he is utterly ancient, and he was already old when he released his Eldunarí. 

After the eventual return of the [[Dragon Rider|Riders]] and the [[New Rider Order|New Rider Order]], he traveled with many pairs of dragons and Riders across Alagaësia and, sometimes, beyond. He has seen much and has a cast collection of memories, knowledge, and stories. He is considered the wisest of the [[Eldunarí|Eldunarya]] on [[Vroengard|Vroengard]]. 

His Eldunarí is large, though small than one might expect given his total age. It is a pale green gem. Currently, [[Bastille Soulkeeper|Bastille Soulkeeper]] has possession of it.
