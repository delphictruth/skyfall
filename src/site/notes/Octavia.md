# Octavia Wildheart
Octavia is a jet-black wild-born [[Dragon|dragon]], bonded to [[Bastille Soulkeeper|Bastille Soulkeeper]]. She has a slender, lean build, which she takes great pride in. Her eyes of a light grey, and some claim that you can see her "wild blood" in their appearance. 

Notably, she was not meant to be a [[Dragon Rider|Rider]]'s dragon. Her egg was not one of those gifted to the [[Dragon Rider|Riders]], and thus was expected to hatch normally in the wild. Instead, it was by mere happenstance that she hatched for [[Bastille Soulkeeper|Bastille Soulkeeper]], who is the only [[Dragon Rider|Rider]] currently alive whom the wild dragons let near their nests.
