# Eldfyrn
>tag

Eldfyrn was the [[Dragon|dragon]] bonded to [[Raegal|Raegal]]. He was also [[Zaniel|Zaniel]]'s elder brother, though his egg was given to the [[Dragon Rider|Riders]] while [[Zaniel|Zaniel]] remained wild. He was slightly on the large side, with bright red scales, and 16 at death.

At the time of his death, he had not released his [[Eldunarí|Eldunarí]] and therefore he died with his body and his Rider in the [[Second Rider Rebellion|Second Rider Rebellion]]. 

[[Zaniel|Zaniel]] tells [[Hazel Goldenblood|Hazel Goldenblood]] that Eldfyrn was too stubborn and too wild at heart to ever submit to living on in his Eldunarí, let alone after the death of his Rider.
